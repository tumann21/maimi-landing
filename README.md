Miami-landing is a study project.

In this project I used such technologies: BEM, Sass.
There are four blocks: header, nav, main and footer.
This landing is adapted for different screens from mobile (> 320px) to large screens 2560px.

## Github flow
1. **Fork** the repo.
2. **Clone** the forked one. (The project link should have your name but not `mate-academy`)
3. Run `npm install` (or just `npm i`).
4. Run `npm start`.
